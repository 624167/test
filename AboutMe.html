	<p> This is the page about me! I've had previous experience with HTML and a little bit of CSS back in Grade 10,in communications technology where we had to make a few websites based on HTML. My interests include reading, listening to music, watching television and etc. I look forward to making various projects in this class such as games, or websites. I hope to learn more languages to further my knowledge in Computer Science.</p>
